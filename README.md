## Build Setup

> WARNING
> It is currently recommended to use Yarn instead of npm when installing VuePress into an existing project that has webpack 3.x as a > dependency. Npm fails to generate the correct dependency tree in this case.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# dev
yarn dev

# build
yarn build
```
